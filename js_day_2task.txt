write a blog difference between document and window object?

    Document represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser and 
    window represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.

    Document is loaded inside the window. Window is the very first object that is loaded 
    in the browser.

    Document is the object of window property. Window is the object of the browser.

    All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document whether,
    global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.

    We can access the document from a window using the window. document and 
    we can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window

    The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model) and
    the window is part of BOM, not DOM.

    Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed 
    by a window like this window. document.title whether, Properties of the window object
    cannot be accessed by the document object.
